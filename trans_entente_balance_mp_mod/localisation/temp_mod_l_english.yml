 remove_shackles_desc:0 "In order to make the game playable until the 1960s the minor's ability to field massive armies and produce massive ammounts of equipment was limited.

 shackles.1.t:0 "AI Shackles"
 shackles.1.d:0 "HoI4 late game is notorious for its slow down. This is caused by AI nations building copious amounts of military equipment and training huge armies, even tiny nations. This is a problem by the end of the 1940s and even more so into the 1950s and 1960s, which have a significant impact in the game performance. AI Shackles mod adds production and recruitment limitations to those minor countries in order to ensure a playable game. Some countries, like Brazil and Argentina, which had a reasonable industry but did not much care for conflicts abroad (until, in the case of Brazil for example, they were dragged to it) will have a limitation on recruitable manpower only, while others (like El Salvador), will have both manpower and industry capped. \n\nIf you decided to impose these limitations, called shackles, on the AI, it can be removed via a decision (costs 1pp) if you want to play with a minor nation. Or you can play without them from the beginning, for all countries, but it will most certainly adversely impact the game performance. Its your choice.\n\nI invite you to check the Extended Tech Tree 1960 mod on Steam to continue playing way past the normal end date with new content."
